  text: "You create an illusion at a point within 20 fathoms. The illusion must be able to fit in a 3-fathom cube. The illusion can affect up to three senses. For each sense after the first that the illusion affects, the duration of the spell is reduced (2 senses: minutes, 3 senses: rounds). If you can see the illusion, you can move it and change its content, but not which senses are affected. If left unattended, the illusion continues what it was doing. [newline] \\example{You could set an illusion of a man walking in a circle that would continue even after you are gone, but if you wanted to change it so that the man was doing jumping jacks, you would have to be able to see the illusion. It is possible to set an illusion directly on top of yourself and move it as you move, so that it functions as a disguise.}"
