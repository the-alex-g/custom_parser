 The owner of this staff gets +1 to cast and -1 on spell failure rolls for spells that summon
 daemons. [newline] Once per day, the owner of the staff can spend an action to speak a command word
 and fire a hail of coldiron shards in a 4-fathom cone. Any creatures in the cone suffer piercing
 damage equal to the wielder's Int, halved with a successful [check Evd 8]. These darts are treated
 as a coldiron weapon.
