[section 0 Rules]

[section 1 Stuff]

Your Evasion is equal to your Speed bonus, plus one if your Dex bonus is +2 or higher, or -1 if your Dex bonus is -2 or lower, minus your
Size bonus.
Your Health is equal to 4 plus your Con bonus.

[section 1 Attacking]

When you make an attack, you must first choose an equipped weapon to attack with and a target within range of that weapon.
Roll that weapon's attack die. If the result is a 1, or less than or equal to the target's Evasion minus your Dexterity, the attack misses.
Otherwise, the attack hits, inflicting one wound on the target. Furthermore, if the result is more than 4 and also greater than the size
of the die minus your Strength, or if the result is the maximum possible value, you may make another attack against the same target.
[example Fredrick wants to attack a goblin using his longsword. Fredrick has +2 Strength and +0 Dexterity, and the goblin has
an Evasion of 12. Fredrick rolls a d20 and adds his Dex for a total of 13, which hits the goblin. He rolls a d8 and gets a 7, then rolls
again and gets a 5, for a total of two wounds. The goblin only had 1 health, and it falls under his mighty blow.]

[section 1 Defending]

If a monster is attacking a player character, resolve as above. After the attack has been rolled and the number of incoming wounds is
known, the player rolls their Armor die once for each wound. For each result equal to or greater than the armor's threshold, one wound
is negated.
[example One of the goblin's friends attacks Fredrick back, hitting for 1 wound. Fredrick has type 4 armor (d6/4), so rolls a d6 once. If he rolls a 
4 or better, the wound is negated.]

[section 1 Spellcasting]

When you cast a spell, unless its duration is instantaneous or permanent, roll 1d4 and add your spellcasting modifier. The result is how
many units of time the spell lasts.
[example Althier, a wizard, casts [spell Shield], with a duration of rounds. He rolls 1d4 and adds his Lor bonus, getting a total of
3. Therefore, his shield spell lasts for three rounds.]

If the spell directly targets a creature with spell resistance, the cost of the spell is increased by that creature's spell resistance.
If not directly targeted by a spell, but still affected by one (like being in the radius of a [spell Fireball]), that creature adds its
spell resistance to any checks required by the spell.

[section 1 Classes]

[section 2 Bards]

Bards are proficient with weapons up to d6 and armor up to type 3.

Bards have a number of saga points equal to their Charisma bonus plus the number of languages they know. As an action, you may start
any song you know. Whenever you take damage, or take an action other than continuing the song, you must succeed on a Cha 12 check or
the effects of the song end. As an action, you may end one song currently in effect and spend a saga point to activate that song's
climax effect.

[section 2 Clerics]

Clerics are proficient with weapons up to d8 and armor up to type 4.

A cleric's spellcasting ability is either Insight (usually for good deities), Determination (usually for evil deities), or Charisma.

When you cast a spell, you must make a check with your spellcasting ability. The difficulty is equal to 20 - your favor points + twice
the level of the spell. If you fail, you lose one favor point and the spell fails. Each day, you gain one favor point if you have
fewer than 8, and you lose one favor point if you have more than 10. You may never have fewer than 0 or more than 16 favor points.

For every hour you spend in prayer to your deity, you gain one favor point. You cannot regain more than three favor points in this
way per day.

[italics Spell Drain:] For each point of spell drain, you lose one favor point.

Only clerics have access to the spells from the Circle of Prayers. If your deity is of an evil alignment, spells from the circle of
prayers deal unholy damage instead of holy damage. If your deity is of a neutral alignment, you can choose which damage type is dealt.
When the spells the circle of prayers refer to creatures being aligned or opposed to your deity, it refers to the relationship between
the two alignments as shown on the table below:

Druids can cast six level 1 spells, three level 2 spells, and one level 4 spell. While in an area filled with natural life,

casting in natural surroundings, as well as either two level 1 spells, one level 2 spell, or one level 4 spell.

[italics Spell Drain:] For each point of spell drain, you count as having cast one spell of the lowest level that you can still cast.
[example Dryxi has cast five level 1 spells, and then suffers an effect inflicting two points of spell drain. Dryxi loses his remaining
level 1 spell and one of his remaining level 2 spells.]

[section 2 Fighters]

A shaman's spellcasting ability is Determination.

[section 2 Wizards]

Wizards are proficient with weapons up to d6 and armor up to type 2.

A wizard's spellcasting ability is Lore.

Wizards have a pool of 16 mana points. When you cast a spell, you must spend a number of mana points equal to the spell level. If you don't
have enough mana points to pay for the spell, you cannot cast it.

As an action, you may make a [check Lor med]. If you succeed, you regain 1d3 mana points. If you fail, you take 1d3 unblockable light wounds.
Each day that you get a full night's rest, you regain mana points equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1).

[italics Spell Drain:] Your maximum number of mana points is reduced by the amount of drain. Each day that you get a full night's rest,
your maximum number of mana points is increased by one, to a maximum of the value before drain was applied.

Only wizards have access to the spells from the Circle of the Arcanum.
