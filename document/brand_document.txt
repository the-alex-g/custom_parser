[section 0 Rules]

[section 1 Stuff]

Your Evasion is equal to your Speed bonus, plus one if your Dex bonus is +2 or higher, or -1 if your Dex bonus is -2 or lower, minus your
Size bonus.

Your Health is equal to 4 plus your Con bonus.

Your weapon threshold is the size of the weapon die - Str + 1 (minimum of 5 (or the size of the die), maximum is the die size)

While wielding two melee weapons, you have +1 Evd against melee attacks and +1 to accuracy rolls.

If you can make a reasonable argument for knowing how to do something based on your class, occupation, or race, you can get advantage
on the roll.

Resistance to poison and/or disease grants advantage to checks against poison and/or disease.

Resistance to damage reduces the amount of damage taken by one.

Vulnerability to damage increases the amount of damage taken by one.

Immunity to damage reduces the amount of damage taken to 0.

When dealing damage that has multiple types, use whichever one does the most damage.

[section 1 Resting and Recovery]

When a character gets a full night's rest, they recover 1 light wound or 1 point of attribute drain. If all the character's damage was taken
since their last rest, they heal 1 wound instead. If the character's Con bonus is +3 or greater, they heal 2 light wounds at a time instead of one.
[example Gorthok the barbarian wakes up at 7 health (his maximum). He has a +2 Con bonus. During the course of an adventuresome day, he takes four wounds. That night,
he heals 1 wound. For the next nine nights, he heals one light wound, putting him back at his max health.]

[section 1 Character Creation]

Roll 2d3. Repeat eight times. Assign each result to one of your attributes. The maximum value for that
attribute is the starting value plus 2.
[table cX
Result & Bonus &
2 & -2 &
3 & -1 &
4 & +0 &
5 & +1 &
6 & +2]
[newline big]
Choose a race and class.

Pick an occupation; this is what your character did for a living before becoming an adventurer (sailor, blacksmith, farmer, shepherd, etc.).

Your character can speak the Common tongue and the language of your race. If your Lor bonus is +2 or higher, you know an additional language, or two languages if your Lor is +4 or higher.
If your Cha bonus is +3 or higher, you know another language.

[section 2 Alternate Options]
[bulletlist
Roll 3d3 and remove the lowest value instead of just rolling 2d3. &
Assign results in the order they're rolled, instead of choosing. Then, you may swap two values. &
Distribute +3 among your stats. Then, you can reduce stats by 1 to increase a different stat by 1. Only one stat can be at +3, and none can be less than -2.]

[section 1 Attacking]

When you make an attack, you must first choose an equipped weapon to attack with and a target within range of that weapon.
Roll a d20 and add your Dex bonus (accuracy roll). If the total is equal to or greater than your target's Evd score, the attack hits. Roll your weapon
die. If you roll equal to or over your weapon threshold, roll the weapon die again. You deal wounds equal to the number of dice rolled.

If you rolled a natural 20, or equal to or greater than your critical threshold (default 21), on your accuracy roll, add a d8/5 die to your damage roll.
[example Fredrick wants to attack a goblin using his longsword. Fredrick has +2 Strength and +0 Dexterity, and the goblin has
an Evasion of 12. Fredrick rolls a d20 and adds his Dex for a total of 13, which hits the goblin. He rolls a d8 and gets a 7, then rolls
again and gets a 5, for a total of two wounds. The goblin only had 1 health, and it falls under his mighty blow.]

[section 1 Defending]

If a monster is attacking a player character, resolve as above. After the attack has been rolled and the number of incoming wounds is
known, the player rolls their Armor die once for each wound. For each result equal to or greater than the armor's threshold, one wound
is negated.
[example One of the goblin's friends attacks Fredrick back, hitting for 1 wound. Fredrick has type 4 armor (d6/4), so rolls a d6 once. If he rolls a 
4 or better, the wound is negated.]

[section 1 Light and Sensing]

    # for things like plants without another way to sense and burrowing monsters #
    Truesight & Can see perfectly regardless of light level, can see invisible creatures and objects, and can immediately identify visual illusions
    # extremely magical in nature #]

[section 1 Spellcasting]

When you cast a spell, unless its duration is instantaneous or permanent, roll 1d4 and add your spellcasting modifier. The result is how
many units of time the spell lasts.
[example Althier, a wizard, casts [spell Shield], with a duration of rounds. He rolls 1d4 and adds his Lor bonus, getting a total of
3. Therefore, his shield spell lasts for three rounds.]

If the spell directly targets a creature with spell resistance, the cost of the spell is increased by that creature's spell resistance.
If not directly targeted by a spell, but still affected by one (like being in the radius of a [spell Fireball]), that creature adds its
spell resistance to any checks required by the spell.

[section 2 Non-Spellcasters Casting Spells]

Bards, berserkers, rogues, and fighters can cast level 1 spells from spellstones. When you do, you must succeed on a Det 14 check or
suffer 2 light wounds. # not quite sure about the 'make a check or take damage' bit #

[text ib Casting Spells:] In order to cast a spell, a non-spellcaster must be able to speak and be holding the appropriate spellstone
in one hand. Once a spellstone has been used in this way,
it cannot be used to cast spells again for 24 hours. You cannot cast more than three spells per day in this manner.

[section 1 Races]

any song you know. Whenever you take damage, or take an action other than continuing the song, you must succeed on a Cha 12 check or
the effects of the song end. As an action, you may end one song currently in effect and spend a saga point to activate that song's

The first time each turn that you kill a creature with a melee attack, you may move up to one fathom and make a second melee
attack.

[section 2 Clerics]

Clerics are proficient with weapons up to d8, armor up to type 4, and shields.

When you become a cleric, pick a patron deity. Your deity's alignment affects several spells you cast, and determines which spell circles
you have access to. A typical cleric has access to seven spell circles: the circle of prayers, a deity-specific circle, and five other
circles determined by the deity.

You start with six spell stones. At least three must contain spells from either the circle of prayers or your deity-specific circle.

A cleric's spellcasting ability is either Insight (usually for good deities), Determination (usually for evil deities), or Charisma.

When you cast a spell, you must make a check with your spellcasting ability. The difficulty is equal to 20 - your favor points + twice
the level of the spell. If you fail, you lose one favor point and the spell fails. Each day, you gain one favor point if you have
fewer than 8, and you lose one favor point if you have more than 10. You may never have fewer than 0 or more than 16 favor points.

For every hour you spend in prayer to your deity, you gain one favor point. You cannot regain more than three favor points in this
way per day.

[text ib Spell Drain:] For each point of spell drain, you lose one favor point.

[text ib Casting Spells:] You must be able to speak in order to cast a spell.

[text ib Learning Spells:] You can learn a spell from any spellstone, as long as the spell is in one of your allowed circles. You must
devote at least one day to prayer in order to gain the ability to cast the spell. Doing so [text i permanently] removes all magic from
the spellstone.

Only clerics have access to the spells from the Circle of Prayers. If your deity is of an evil alignment, spells from the circle of
prayers deal unholy damage instead of holy damage. If your deity is of a neutral alignment, you can choose which damage type is dealt.
When the spells the circle of prayers refer to creatures being aligned or opposed to your deity, it refers to the relationship between
the two alignments as shown on the table below:

Druids have six level 1 spell slots, three level 2 spell slots, and one level 4 spell slot. In order to cast a spell,

At dawn each day, you regain all your spell slots for being outdoors. You also regain either two level 1 spell slots, one
level 2 spell slot, or one level 4 spell slot.

[text ib Spell Drain:] For each point of spell drain, you must spend one spell slot of the lowest level available to you.
[example Dryxi has cast five level 1 spells, and then suffers two points of spell drain. Dryxi loses his remaining
level 1 spell and one of his remaining level 2 spells.]
