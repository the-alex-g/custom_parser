This world represents Faerie as Tolkien paints it.

Some steps to make that true:
------------------------------------------
- Make bards more like Gandalf --- words are Power
- Create random tables that tap into the wonder of exploration
    random encounter tables
    random herb tables (Crown and Skull)
- Monsters at their best should also be wondrous (the foreword to the KBP Tome
of Beasts mentions that point)
#

[section 0 Rules]

[section 1 Resting and Recovery]

When a character gets a full night's rest, they recover 1 light wound or 1 point of attribute drain. If all the character's damage was taken
since their last rest, they heal 1 wound instead. If the character's Con bonus is +3 or greater, they heal 2 light wounds at a time instead of one.
[example Gorthok the barbarian wakes up at 7 health (his maximum). He has a +2 Con bonus. During the course of an adventuresome day, he takes four wounds. That night,
he heals 1 wound. For the next nine nights, he heals one light wound, putting him back at his max health.]

[section 1 Character Creation]

Roll eight times on the table below. Assign each result to one of your attributes. The maximum value for that
attribute is the starting value plus 2.
[dicetable 2d3 Bonus -2 & -1 & +0 & +1 & +2]
[newline big]
Choose a race and class.

Pick an occupation; this is what your character did for a living before becoming an adventurer (sailor, blacksmith, farmer, shepherd, etc.).

Your character can speak the Common tongue and the language of your race. If your Lor bonus is +2 or higher, you know an additional language, or two languages if your Lor is +4 or higher.
If your Cha bonus is +3 or higher, you know another language.

If you can make a reasonable argument for knowing how to do something based on your class, occupation, or race, you can get advantage
on the roll.
[example Fredrick is a human fighter who grew up on a farm. It would be
reasonable to give him advantage when identifying quality weapons or
helping plow a field, but probably not when he's trying to decipher arcane
runes or build a mechanical servant.]

Advantage should not normally be given to attack or spellcasting rolls because
of race, class, or occupation.

[section 2 Alternate Options]
[bulletlist
Roll 3d3 and remove the lowest value instead of just rolling 2d3. &
Assign results in the order they're rolled, instead of choosing. Then, you may swap two values. &
Distribute +3 among your stats. Then, you can reduce stats by 1 to increase a different stat by 1. Only one stat can be at +3, and none can be less than -2.]

[section 1 Calculated Attributes]
Your Evasion is equal to your Speed bonus, plus one if your Dex bonus is +2 or higher, or -1 if your Dex bonus is -2 or lower, minus your
Size bonus.

Your Health is equal to 4 plus your Con bonus. Temporary modifiers to Con never
change your health.

Your speed in fathoms per round (which is equal to feet per second) is based on
your Speed bonus.
[table cX

[section 1 Coinage]
The following table shows common coinages and their relative values.
[table ccccc
& iron (i) & copper (c) & silver (s) & gold (g) &

g & 1/100 & 1/50 & 1/5 & 1]

You can roll on the following table to randomly determine price changes.
[dicetable 2d6 Price -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & +0 & +1 & +2 & +3 & +4 & +5]

[section 1 Weapons]
Ultimately, there are only four categories of weapons that you can buy, determined by
their attack die. Some examples of weapons are shown in the table below, but a weapon's
type is left open for interpretation. Similarly, the type of damage that a weapon does
is assumed to be self-evident (swords deal slashing damage, clubs deal bludgeoning, etc.).
[table cXc
Die & Examples & Cost &
d4 & dagger, club, sling & 5c &
d6 & arming sword, bow, axe, mace & 10c &
d8 & longsword, warbow, spear & 1s &
d10 & greatsword, maul, waraxe, crossbow & 2s]

Weapons with a d8 or larger die are two-handed, as are all ranged weapons.

An action must be spent to load a crossbow-type weapon before it can be
fired again. Crossbow attacks always have a weapon threshold of 5.

Polearm-type weapons have reach, which allows you to attack targets up to 2 fathoms away.
When attacking nearby targets with a weapon with reach, you have disadvantage on the
accuracy roll.
[table lc
Weapon & Range &
Bow & [range bow t] &
Crossbow & [range crossbow t] &
Sling & [range sling t] &
Thrown & [range thrown t] &
Warbow & [range warbow t]]

The weapon threshold is calculated based on your Str bonus and the size of
the weapon's die, as shown on the following table.
[table ccccc
Str & d4 & d6 & d8 & d10 &
1 or less & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 &
+2  & 4 & 5 & 7 & 9 &
+3  & 4 & 5 & 6 & 8 &
+4  & 4 & 5 & 5 & 7]

While wielding two melee weapons, you have +1 Evd against melee attacks and +1 to accuracy rolls.

[section 1 Armor]
[table cccccc
Type & Die & Name & Dex & Spd & Cost &
0 & d6/6 & No armor & - & - & - &

Additional armor types, usually used for magical, crude, or masterwork armor. Dex and Spd
penalties are the same as the base type.

4+/5- & d10/4 & 20g &
5+/6- & d10/3 & 60g &
6+ & d8/2 & 100g]

[section 1 Attacking]

When you make an attack, you must first choose an equipped weapon to attack with and a target within range of that weapon.
Roll a d20 and add your Dex bonus (accuracy roll). If the total is equal to or greater than your target's Evd score, the attack hits. Roll your weapon
die. If you roll equal to or over your weapon threshold, roll the weapon die again. You deal wounds equal to the number of dice rolled.

If you rolled a natural 20, or equal to or greater than your critical threshold (default 21), on your accuracy roll, add a d8/5 die to your damage roll.
[example Fredrick wants to attack a goblin using his longsword. Fredrick has +2 Strength and +0 Dexterity, and the goblin has
an Evasion of 12. Fredrick rolls a d20 and adds his Dex for a total of 13, which hits the goblin. He rolls a d8 and gets a 7, then rolls
again and gets a 5, for a total of two wounds. The goblin only had 1 health, and it falls under his mighty blow.]

[section 2 Damage and Resistance]

Throughout these rules, the terms "wound" and "damage" are used interchangeably.
3 light wounds is equal to 1 "regular" wound.
[example If you suffer 1 wound, and then heal 1 light wound, you have a net loss
of 2 light wounds.]

Resistance to damage reduces the amount of damage taken by one.

Vulnerability to damage increases the amount of damage taken by one.

Immunity to damage reduces the amount of damage taken to 0.

When dealing damage that has multiple types, use whichever one does the most damage.
[section 1 Defending]

Whenever a player takes damage, unless the damage is unblockable, the player rolls
their Armor die once for each wound. For each result equal to or greater than the
armor's threshold, one wound is negated. If the damage is measured in light wounds, one
success on the armor roll blocks three light wounds.
[example One of the goblin's friends attacks Fredrick back, hitting for 1 wound. Fredrick has type 3 armor (d6/4), so rolls a d6 once. If he rolls a 
4 or better, the wound is negated.]

[section 1 Light and Sensing]
[table lX
    Light Level & Penalties & 
    Bright Light & No penalties &
    Dim Light & +2 Evasion &
    Darkness & Creatures in darkness cannot be seen &
    Utter Darkness & Creatures in utter darkness cannot be seen]
[table lX
    Sense & Benefit &
    Blindsight & Can sense surroundings, regardless of ability to see &
    # for creatures that cannot see with eyes, but can still detect their surroundings #
    Darksight & Can see normally, regardless of light level &
    # magical in nature #
    Dimsight & Can see as if the light level were one higher &
    # natural keen night vision #
    Sense Living & Can sense living creatures, regardless of ability to see &
    # for telepaths and powerful undead #
    Tremorsense & Can sense moving things, regardless of ability to see &
    # for things like plants without another way to sense and burrowing monsters #
    Truesight & Can see perfectly regardless of light level, can see invisible creatures and objects, and can immediately identify visual illusions
    # extremely magical in nature #]

[section 1 Attribute Drain]

Some effects cause attribute drain. For each point of attribute drain, reduce
the bonus for that attribute by one. Attribute drain can be recovered by resting
(see the "Resting and Recovery" section). Attributes cannot be reduced to less
than -5.

Special effects apply when your attributes are reduced to -5. Effects cease
immediately once the attribute has increased.
[table cX
Attribute & Effect &
Str & Too weak to move or speak &
Dex & Incapable of coordinated movement &
Con & Death &
Spd & Paralyzed &
Lor & Incapable of any thought or action &
Ins & Completely insane &
Det & Incapable of decision &
Cha & Loses all semblance of social grace]

[section 1 Poisons and Diseases]

Only living creatures are affected by poisons or diseases.

Resistance to poison and/or disease grants advantage to checks against poison and/or disease.

[section 1 Movement]
On your turn, you may move a number of fathoms equal to your movement speed.
Difficult terrain requires you to spend twice as much movement.

[section 2 Attacks of Opportunity]
If you begin your turn outside the reach of an enemy with a reach weapon (spear, halberd,
etc.), and you end your turn near that enemy, that enemy may make a free attack against
you with their reach weapon.

[section 1 Spellcasting]

When you cast a spell, unless its duration is instantaneous or permanent, roll 1d4 and add your spellcasting modifier. The result is how
many units of time the spell lasts.
[example Althier, a wizard, casts [spell Shield], with a duration of rounds. He rolls 1d4 and adds his Lor bonus, getting a total of
3. Therefore, his shield spell lasts for three rounds.]

If the spell directly targets a creature with spell resistance, the cost of the spell is increased by that creature's spell resistance.
If not directly targeted by a spell, but still affected by one (like being in the radius of a [spell Fireball]), that creature adds its
spell resistance to any checks required by the spell.

[section 2 Non-Spellcasters Casting Spells]

Bards, berserkers, rogues, and fighters can cast level 1 spells from spellstones. When you do, you must succeed on a Det 14 check or
suffer 2 light wounds. # not quite sure about the 'make a check or take damage' bit #

[text ib Casting Spells:] In order to cast a spell, a non-spellcaster must be able to speak and be holding the appropriate spellstone
in one hand. Once a spellstone has been used in this way,
it cannot be used to cast spells again for 24 hours. You cannot cast more than three spells per day in this manner.

[section 1 Races]
[table ccX
Race & Size & Bonuses &
Dwarf & 1/2 & Dimsight, +1 to Con and Det, -1 to Cha, magic resist 2, resist poison and disease &
Elf & 1 & Dimsight, +1 to Lor, Ins, Dex, and Cha, resist poison and disease &
Gnome & 1/2 & Dimsight, +1 to Dex and Ins, -1 to Con, magic resist 1 &
Halfling & 1/2 & A number of times per day equal to your Cha bonus (min 1), you can re-roll any die &

[section 1 Classes]

[section 2 Bards]

Bards are proficient with weapons up to d6 and armor up to type 3.

You start knowing four of the eight basic bardic themes and one additional language of your choice.

[extra_attacks 2 4]

Bards have a number of saga points equal to their Charisma bonus plus the number of languages they know. As an action, you may start
any song you know. Whenever you take damage, or take an action other than continuing the song, you must succeed on a Cha 12 check or
the effects of the song end. As an action, you may end one song currently in effect and spend a saga point to activate that song's
climax effect.

[text ib Learning Songs:] Bard songs can be transferred in any written or spoken form. To learn a new song, you must be able to understand
the language it was recorded in, and you must devote at least three days to practicing and memorizing the song.

[section 2 Berserkers]

Berkserkers are proficient with weapons up to d10 and armor up to type 3.

Your maximum health increases by one.

When you attack with a d10 melee weapon, count your strength as 2 higher and reduce your critical threshold by one.

When you attack with any melee weapon, you deal additional light wounds based on the amount of damage you have taken.
[table cX
Damage Taken & Damage Increase &
1 & 1 &
2-4 & d3 &
5-6 & d4 &# Only possible with Con +1 minimum #
7+ & 2d3]# Only possible with Con +3 minimum #
[newline big]
The first time each turn that you kill a creature with a melee attack, you may move up to one fathom and make a second melee
attack.

[section 2 Clerics]

Clerics are proficient with weapons up to d8, armor up to type 4, and shields.

When you become a cleric, #break# pick six circles. You can only cast spells from those circles, as well as the Circle of Prayers. You must also pick an alignment for your deity, which must be aligned with your own (see the alignment table below). #pick a patron deity. Your deity's alignment affects several spells you cast, and determines which spell circles
you have access to. A typical cleric has access to seven spell circles: the circle of prayers, a deity-specific circle, and five other
circles determined by the deity.#

You start with six spell stones. At least three must contain spells from either the circle of prayers or your deity-specific circle.

A cleric's spellcasting ability is either Insight (usually for good deities), Determination (usually for evil deities), or Charisma.

When you cast a spell, you must make a check with your spellcasting ability. The difficulty is equal to 20 - your favor points + twice
the level of the spell. If you fail, you lose one favor point and the spell fails. Each day, you gain one favor point if you have
fewer than 8, and you lose one favor point if you have more than 10. You may never have fewer than 0 or more than 16 favor points.

For every hour you spend in prayer to your deity, you gain one favor point. You cannot regain more than three favor points in this
way per day.

[text ib Spell Drain:] For each point of spell drain, you lose one favor point.

[text ib Casting Spells:] You must be able to speak in order to cast a spell.

[text ib Learning Spells:] You can learn a spell from any spellstone, as long as the spell is in one of your allowed circles. You must
devote at least one day to prayer in order to gain the ability to cast the spell. Doing so [text i permanently] removes all magic from
the spellstone.

Only clerics have access to the spells from the Circle of Prayers. If your deity is of an evil alignment, spells from the circle of
prayers deal unholy damage instead of holy damage. If your deity is of a neutral alignment, you can choose which damage type is dealt.
When the spells the circle of prayers refer to creatures being aligned or opposed to your deity, it refers to the relationship between
the two alignments as shown on the table below:
[table cXX

[section 2 Druids]

Druids are proficient with weapons up to d6 and armor up to type 2. While you are wielding a metal weapon or wearing metal armor, you cannot cast spells.

A druid's spellcasting ability is Insight.

You can only cast spells from the following circles: air, beasts, earth, fire, growth, ice, life, moon, sun, and water.
You start with six spell stones, which cannot contain spells from more than four circles.

Druids have six level 1 spell slots, three level 2 spell slots, and one level 4 spell slot. In order to cast a spell,
you must spend a spell slot of the same level. If you have no spell slots of the appropriate level, you may not cast
the spell. While outdoors, you have an additional two level 1 spell slots and one level 2 spell slot. These spell slots
must be spent before your other ones.

At dawn each day, you regain all your spell slots for being outdoors. You also regain either two level 1 spell slots, one
level 2 spell slot, or one level 4 spell slot.

[text ib Spell Drain:] For each point of spell drain, you must spend one spell slot of the lowest level available to you.
[example Dryxi has cast five level 1 spells, and then suffers two points of spell drain. Dryxi loses his remaining
level 1 spell and one of his remaining level 2 spells.]

[text ib Casting Spells:] You must be able to speak and have a spellstone of the spell in your possession in order to cast a spell.

[text ib Learning Spells:] When you aquire a spellstone, you must devote at least one day, spent in a natural setting, to attune to the
spirits of the spellstone.

Only druids have access to the Druidic Circle.
[include circle include/druid_circle.yaml]

[section 2 Fighters]

Fighters are proficient with weapons up to d10, armor up to type 6, and shields.

When you become a fighter, choose up to two hand's worth of weapons or shields to be your signature armament. While wielding your

for a different class.

When you cast a spell, you must make a Det 14 check. If you fail, you take unblockable light wounds equal to the level of the spell.
Regardless of success or failure, the spell is cast.

[text ib Spell Drain:] Suffer one unblockable light wound for each point of spell drain.

[text ib Casting Spells:] You must be holding the appropriate spellstone in order to cast a spell. If you cannot speak, you have

Wizards have a pool of 16 mana points. When you cast a spell, you must spend a number of mana points equal to the spell level. If you don't
have enough mana points to pay for the spell, you cannot cast it.

As an action, you may make a [check Lor med]. If you succeed, you regain 1d3 mana points. If you fail, you take 1d3 unblockable light wounds.
Each day that you get a full night's rest, you regain mana points equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1).

[text ib Spell Drain:] Your maximum number of mana points is reduced by the amount of drain. Each day that you get a full night's rest,
