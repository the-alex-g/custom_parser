     This spell targets one friendly creature within 3 fathoms. The target's armor counts as type 6, and they have +4 to Evasion. The spell ends immediately if the target attacks or casts an offensive
     spell.
  Warden:

    duration: minutes
    text: >
     This spell targets two friendly creatures within 3 fathoms. One of the target is designated as the warden for the other (the guarded creature). Whenever the guarded creature takes damage, after
     rolling for armor, if not all the damage was blocked, the damage is reduced by one and the warden takes one unblockable damage. When the warden is reduced to one health, they may choose to end the spell
     immediately.
     [example Fredrick is the warden for his ally, Ojrd. Ojrd is hit by an attack for two damage. He rolls his armor, blocking one of the two damage. Fredrick suffers the other incoming damage, and Ojrd
     remains unharmed.]
