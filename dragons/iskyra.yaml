- Drake-Mother
abilities:
  Shining Scales: While in bright light, attacks made against the dragon by creatures that can see it with mundane vision have disadvantage.
 Scale Barrage @: The dragon hurls a shower of its razor-sharp scales. All creatures in a 6-fathom cone take 4 slashing damage, or half as much with a successful [check Evd Dex], and targets that can see must succeed on a [check Dex 10] or be blinded until the end of their next turn.
 The Little Ones @: The dragon summons 1d4 + 1 glowing draconic sprites. No more than 8 sprites may exist at the same time. The dragon may destroy one of these sprites to block 1 damage from any attack made within 10 fathoms, heal 1 wound from any creature within 10 fathoms, or deal 1 magic slashing damage to any creature within 10 fathoms. The sprites have Evd 10 and are destroyed by any amount of damage
