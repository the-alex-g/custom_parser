text: The [name] is an incomprehensible creature composed entirely of rubbery flesh. They are extremely rare in nature, but can be summoned to serve as a reliable guardian for a location, item, or even person. A summoned [name] serves with complete obedience for exactly 40 years, after which it vanishes back to wherever it came from. [newline] Summoning a [name] as a guardian requires the following additional ritual. Three foot-long obsidian needles (average cost 1g each) must be acquired. Two must be used to sacrifice a white squirrel, and the third is used to draw a dram of blood from the caster (dealing one wound). The blood of the sacrifice and the caster is spread on the area, item, or person the summoned [name] will protect. The summoning spell must be cast immediately afterward. As the [name] appears, the needles, squirrel, and blood are subsumed into its rubbery mass.
