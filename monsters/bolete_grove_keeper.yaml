 While in its grove, the grove keeper's tremorsense and telepathy extend to the
 outskirts of its grove.[newline]
 Bolete grove keepers can apply a fungal mark to other creatures and objects.
 This mark shows that the recipient is a friend of the boletes, and will usually
 be treated kindly by other fungal creatures. The mark lasts for about a week
 before fading. [newline]
 Bolete 'telepathy' is actually accomplished by sending message spores back and
 forth. [newline]
 The grove keepers carry the memories of the entire grove, from its founding
 to the present. As such, grove keepers are immensely wise, but are also
 somewhat distant from the world around them. [newline]
 There is little distinction between grove and grove keeper. Even if its body is
 destroyed, the grove keeper's collective memories can live on in the fungi of
 the grove until the gardeners craft a new body for the grove keeper.
 Some grove keepers eschew a traditional body altogether, preferring to remain
 assimilated among the mushrooms of their grove.
 # Boletes are almost evenly split between neutral good, true neutral, and
 neutral evil. Good-aligned bolete groves usually keep to themselves, but
 willingly help anyone who comes into their grove seeking aid.
 Neutral boletes are strictly isolationist.
 Evil boletes enjoy killing things and are usually seeking more territory. They
 attack other bolete groves whenever possible, because subverting an existing
 grove is generally easier than starting a new one. #
