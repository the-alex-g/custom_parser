 Thorny stalkers are usually found either singly or in groups of four or five.
 They hunt in a way very similar to wolves, sometimes chasing their prey across
 long distances before finally bringing it down. Unlike many predators, thorny
 stalkers completely ignore animals that are already dead.[newline]
 When a thorny stalker makes a kill, it leaves a small piece of one if its vines
 near the corpse. This vine takes root and grows quickly into a new thorny
 stalker. A mature thorny stalker usually lives for about two weeks before dying
 and rotting away.
