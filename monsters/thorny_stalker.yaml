text: Thorny stalkers are usually found either singly or in groups of four or five.
  They hunt in a way very similar to wolves, sometimes chasing their prey across long
  distances before finally bringing it down. Unlike many predators, thorny stalkers
  completely ignore animals that are already dead.[newline] When a thorny stalker
  makes a kill, it leaves a small piece of one if its vines near the corpse. This
  vine takes root and grows quickly into a new thorny stalker. A mature thorny stalker
  usually lives for about two weeks before dying and rotting away.
