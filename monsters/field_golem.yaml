 A field golem can be created through a ritual of low magic. First, certain herbs worth at least
 1 gc must be found or purchased. These herbs must be crushed and mixed with soil in a clay pot.
 Then a potato must be planted in this pot. When the potato is fully grown, in about 9 (2d4 + 4)
 weeks, it will be bright yellow and about the size of a fist. When planted in the ground, a field
 golem forms around the potato over the course of 2 (1d4) rounds and rises from the ground under the
 control of whoever planted it. Any field golems previously animated by that person fall apart. The
 golem remains animated for 4 (1d4 + 2) weeks, after which it crumbles back to earth.
