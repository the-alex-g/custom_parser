 Elves, dryads, and other forest dwellers sometimes keep moss salamanders as pets. They are loyal to
 their master and valued for their ability to generate healing moss. This moss can be harvested and
 used as a poultice to heal injuries.

 In the wild, moss salamanders dwell in family groups of three to six members. Young moss salamanders
 are carefully tended by their parents, and reach adulthood after about three years.

 A large, six-legged lizardish creature suddenly rises from the forest floor. You hadn't
 noticed it before because it appears to be made of thick moss, blending in perfectly with the
 other vegetation.
