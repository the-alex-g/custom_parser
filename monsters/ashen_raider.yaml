text: Ashen raiders are evil minions created by reciting an incantation over a mixture
  of blood, ash, and mud. The blood must come from the ritual sacrifice of a sentient
  creature, with a single sacrifice supplying enough blood to create at more than
  20 ashen raiders. The blood of more powerful creatures can be used to make more
  powerful minions. [newline] Ashen raiders can understand and obey simple commands
  from their creator, but their essential nature is one of hatred. Left to their own
  devices, a group of ashen raiders will destroy everything within reach, including
  each other. [newline] When an ashen raider dies, its body collapses into viscous
  mud.
