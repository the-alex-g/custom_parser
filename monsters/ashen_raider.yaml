 A humanoid creature with brown-red skin charges at you, brandishing a large
 sword. Its features are soft, like they had been sculpted out of clay, but its
 black eyes gleam with hatred.

 Ashen raiders are evil minions created by reciting an incantation over a mixture
 of blood, ash, and mud. The blood must come from the ritual sacrifice of a
 sentient creature, with a single sacrifice supplying enough blood to create
 at more than 20 ashen raiders. The blood of more powerful creatures can be
 used to make more powerful minions.

 Ashen raiders can understand and obey simple commands from their creator, but their essential nature
 is one of hatred. Left to their own devices, a group of ashen raiders will destroy
 everything within reach, including each other.

 When an ashen raider dies, its body collapses into viscous mud.
