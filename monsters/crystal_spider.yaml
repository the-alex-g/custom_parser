special:
  Bite: If a creature takes damage from the bite attack and is already suffering from
    crystallizing sickness, that creature must immediately make a check against the
    disease.
  Crystalline Web: 'Whenever a creature makes a Str or Dex check to escape the crystalline
    webbing, that creature suffers 1 slashing damage from the sharp crystal.

    '
  Crystallizing Sickness (disease): 'Every 24 hours, the diseased creature must succeed
    on a [check con 12] or suffer 1 point of Dex and Spd drain. The diseased creature''s
    armor type is equal to half the total amount of Dex drain inflicted, unless the
    creature is wearing heavier armor already. If a creature''s Spd or Dex bonus is
    reduced to -5, the creature is turned into solid crystal, mostly quartz, until
    the disease is cured. A fully crystallized creature no longer makes checks against
    the disease. The disease is cured after two consecutive successful checks.
