  Breath of Darkness [recharge 5-6 p c] @: 'The dragon exhales liquid shadow, which
    coalesces into a sphere 6 fathoms in diameter, centered on a point within 8 fathoms
    of the dragon. This area is utterly dark, and any creature that starts its turn
    in the region suffers d4/4 necrotic damage. If the creature takes any damage,
    they must also succeed on a [check det det] or suffer 1 point of Con drain. The
    sphere of darkness dissipates after 1d4 + 2 rounds, or when the dragon uses this
    ability again.

  Shadow Stealth: 'While in darkness, the shadow dragon is invisible. While in dim
