  Shadow Stealth: >
   While in darkness, the shadow dragon is invisible. While in dim light, it can only be seen by
   creatures with a special sense. Other shadow dragons can still see invisible shadow dragons.
  Breath of Darkness [recharge 5-6 p c] @: >
   The dragon exhales liquid shadow, which coalesces into a sphere 6 fathoms in diameter, centered
   on a point within 8 fathoms of the dragon. This area is utterly dark, and any creature that starts
   its turn in the region suffers d4/4 necrotic damage. If the creature takes any damage, they must
   also succeed on a [check det det] or suffer 1 point of Con drain. The sphere of darkness
   dissipates after 1d4 + 2 rounds, or when the dragon uses this ability again.
