 Attach @: >
  The dreamsilk makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, it attaches itself to its target's head.
  For the first 1d4 minutes while attached, the target has -2 to Dex and Per as it suffers from
  dreamlike hallucinations. For up to one hour afterwards, the target gains a +1 bonus to Cha
  and Int. Removing the dreamsilk requires [effort 4 dex]. Only one dreamsilk may attach to a
  creature at a time.
