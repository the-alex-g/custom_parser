 Absorb Thoughts: >
  One living creature within 10 fathoms of the moss must succeed on a [check int int], or the
  moss regains 1 health. If the creature failed by 5 or more, the moss also recovers one point
  of Int drain.
 Fragile Intellect: >
  For each point of damage that the moss suffers, it also suffers 1 point of Int drain.
 Information Saturation: >
  The first time each round that a living creature touches the moss with its bare skin, it is
  subject to the moss' psychic crush ability.
 Psychic Crush: >
  One living creature within 10 fathoms of the moss must succeed on a [check int int] or
  suffer 1 unblockable psychic damage and be unable to take actions on its next turn. If the creature
  succeeds, it may make a second check. If it succeeds on that check, it gets a +1 bonus to Int that
  lasts for 2d4 hours. This bonus is not cumulative.
 Spell Capture: >
  When a creature casts a spell within 10 fathoms of the moss, the moss can make an Int check
  with a difficulty of 10 + twice the spell's cost. On a success, the moss captures an imprint
  of the spell. The moss can then cast this imprint as an action. The moss cannot have two imprinted
  spells at the same time.
