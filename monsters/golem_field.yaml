text: A field golem can be created through a ritual of low magic. First, certain herbs
  worth at least 1 gc must be found or purchased. These herbs must be crushed and
  mixed with soil in a clay pot. Then a potato must be planted in this pot. When the
  potato is fully grown, in about 9 (2d4 + 4) weeks, it will be bright yellow and
  about the size of a fist. When planted in the ground, a field golem forms around
  the potato over the course of 2 (1d4) rounds and rises from the ground under the
  control of whoever planted it. Any field golems previously animated by that person
  fall apart. The golem remains animated for 4 (1d4 + 2) weeks, after which it crumbles
  back to earth.
