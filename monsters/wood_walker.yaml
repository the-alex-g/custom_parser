  Explosive Globes (3/day):
   The wood walker ejects a cloud of floating spheres that fill the area within
   4 fathoms. For each fathom that a non-plant creature moves within the area,
   they must succeed on a [check dex easy] or take d4/4 fire damage as the
   spheres explode.
   [newline]
   The spheres become ineffective after they have been set off 1d3 + 1 times, or
   after 1d3 + 1 minutes.
